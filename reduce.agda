-- Defines big-step reduction semantics for our combinators.
-- Read as a proposition: Every term is weakly normalizing.
-- Read as a program: Reduces a term A to a normal form B,
--    with proof that A reduces to B.
-- This is quite standard, except that we also need to compute
-- a proof alongside the normal form.
